- Calculation of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualization of confusion matrices for model assessment.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning)
- pandas (for data handling)
- numpy (for numerical operations)
- matplotlib (for data visualization)
- Other required libraries (e.g., seaborn, colorama)


Machine Learning Models

This section provides an overview of the machine learning models used in the COVID-19 prediction system. The following models have been implemented and evaluated:

Support Vector Classifier (SVC): A model that classifies data into two categories by finding the hyperplane that best separates the classes.

Logistic Regression: A model used for binary classification that estimates the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class.

Decision Tree Classifier: A model that makes decisions by recursively splitting the data into subsets based on the most significant attributes.

Random Forest Classifier: An ensemble model that consists of multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

Gaussian Naive Bayes: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem that calculates the probability of an instance belonging to a class.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): A model that classifies data points based on the majority class among their nearest neighbors.


Performance Metrics
This section outlines the performance metrics used to assess the effectiveness of the machine learning models in COVID-19 prediction. The following metrics are calculated for each model:

Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.

Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total predicted positive instances.

Recall: The ratio of correctly predicted positive instances to the total actual positive instances.

F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them.


Confusion Matrices
Confusion matrices are visual representations of model performance on both the training and testing datasets. They provide a detailed breakdown of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives, allowing for a better understanding of a model's classification accuracy.
